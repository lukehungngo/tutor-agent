# Summary of Document Analysis Strategies
1. Comprehensive Analysis
Description: AI thoroughly examines the entire document to extract main topics, key concepts, and suggested sections.
Pros: Deep, coherent understanding, excellent question quality.
Cons: Computationally intensive; possible omission of nuanced details.

2. Chunk-based Analysis
Description: Splits document into smaller segments, generating questions per chunk independently.
Pros: Simple, scalable, ensures broad coverage.
Cons: May lack thematic coherence; potential repetition.

3. Semantic Clustering Analysis
Description: Groups document chunks by semantic similarity, then analyzes representative chunks per cluster.
Pros: Ensures coverage of diverse themes; efficient.
Cons: Moderate complexity; clustering quality dependent on embeddings.

4. User-Assisted Tagging & Highlighting
Description: Users explicitly mark important sections or provide summaries to guide AI analysis.
Pros: High relevance; user control reduces AI oversight.
Cons: Requires active user engagement.

5. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Description: Initial comprehensive thematic analysis followed by chunk-based validation.
Pros: Balances depth and coverage; minimizes overlooked details.
Cons: Slightly more complex; requires good orchestration.

6. Iterative Refinement
Description: AI generates initial analysis, allowing users to confirm, correct, or expand.
Pros: Highly accurate over iterations; adaptive and user-centric.
Cons: Time-intensive; requires active participation.


## Recommended Optimal Strategy (Not fully covered above)
- Layered Progressive Analysis
- Start with a quick semantic overview (identify general themes).
- Allow the user to confirm/expand themes.
- Proceed with detailed chunk-based analysis within confirmed themes.
- Generate Bloom-aligned questions based on finalized thematic chunks.

### Benefits:
- Ensures broad coverage first, then depth.
- Combines minimal initial AI overhead with user-guided depth.
- Adaptive and scalable.

## Selecting Strategies Based on User Actions
Dynamically adjust strategies based on user behavior:
1. Passive User (minimal input):
→ Comprehensive or Chunk-based analysis

2. Active User (provides summaries/tags):
→ User-Assisted or Hybrid analysis

3. Deep Engagement (feedback loop):
→ Iterative refinement
